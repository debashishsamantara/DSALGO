Subarray ->
 Continuous part of the array
 Number of subarrays of an array with n elements = nC2 + n = n*(n+1)/2

Subsequences ->
  A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by selecting zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.
  Number of subsequences of an array with n elements = 2^n.

Note:- Every subarray is a subsequence but bot viceversa.
